## Overview

This was great to do, as I usually am unsure of my skills as a beginner. I gave myself a deadline and made sure not to use things that weren't necessary like unnecessary css variables(in my case, scss variables), I also made sure to use ms paint to get the accurate colors of the background and texts of the project.

I took time to screenshot how the Desktop and Mobile QR-Code finalized design looks like.

## My process

I started by opening the design folder gotten from the mockup zip file and then observed what the project looked like, then opened vscode and initialized a new repository through the terminal, after initializing and commiting to the remote repo on Github I then opened ms paint to get the widths and heights of the design and also the colors.

After getting all appropriate values I created a html document and then structured the content semantically. After I was done I created an scss file to quickly apply styling as I could nest styles of connected elements which speeds up writing css. I did not use scss variables as I did not see the need to(there aren't repeated styles to warrant mixins, extension and variables).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Footers are sometimes challenging to implement as there are more ways to implement them all with drawbacks, I chose to use absolute positioning to fix the footer to the floor of the webpage and then hid the overflow so the elements are contained along the fullscreen of both mobile and desktop.

### Useful resources

- I did make use of google fonts to get a font that closely matches the design mock-up. https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit

- I also used https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input to validate my html.
